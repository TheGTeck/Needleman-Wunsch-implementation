# Needleman-Wunsch-implementation
Simple implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm i made in early 2016.
I also implemented the affine gap version in this code.

It is written in Python, and comments are in French (sorry about that)
I may propose a more elaborate (and translated) solution if I ever take the time to do so.

This is neither an optimal nor a beautiful implementation, it was basically just intended to be an exercise to understand how this algorithm works.
